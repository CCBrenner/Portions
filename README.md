# Portions

Portions is an idea for a mobile app that I have. "Portions" is a reference to the Scripture portions used in BIble quizzing - a ministry I am a part of.
The Portions app would allow the user to create many portions and use the app's provided tools to achieve initial memorization, reinforcement learning through repeated recall over time, and to maintain a store of different groupings of Portions that others can copy, subscribe to, or invite others to memorize with them. This would allow a user to memorize many verses in the translations that they've chosen for each verse so as to keep translation differences straight in their mind when studying. A recording feature for each portion that could be played back-to-back with other portions would allow the listener to get used to what the verse says or sounds like to further reinforce memorization.

In summary, Portions would be a feature-rich application for Scripture memorization. 

This app also has much more potential for expansion beyond Scripture meorization functions, including incorporating other aspects of the quizzing ministry, hosting quizzing details on the app as a main data source for all local churches, districts, and fields/region (in the Nazarene denomination). It would be cross-ministry and denomination-agnostic since there are different kinds of quizzing ministries typically separated by denominational barriers and Bible translations used for quizzing. There is potential to incorporate local church connection into the ministry (for church leaders to be invited in to get involved and see what is happening) and help people (interested adults and teens) find participating churches in the user's vicinity to be a part of t learn more about quizzing.

This project is still in the technical requirements gathering stage.
